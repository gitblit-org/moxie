<!-- Sometimes, you want maven to download a file from a different place. For
     example the closest Maven mirror. You can do this by configuring <mirror>s
     in settings.xml. But this doesn't work if the mirror IDs (from
     settings.xml) and the repository IDs (from pom.xml) don't match.
     Or what do you do if the POM says to download 
-->
<!-- Redirect all requests to central to the closest mirror -->

<!-- Sometimes, a POM will ask for a file from a mirror. In this case, direct

<!-- These two directories on the server always contain the same content (on

<!-- POM bugfixes -->
<!-- spring-javaconfig believes it has to download releases from m2.safehaus.org.
     Also it uses the wrong path for aopalliance (org.aopalliance instead of aopalliance).
     So we redirect requests for "org/aopalliance" to "aopalliance" and then
     everything else to the root of the mirror -->

<!-- Sometimes, you just need to use snapshots. But most of the time, you just
     want a very specific snapshot, not *all* of them. With deny/allow, you
     can control what Maven can see and what it can't.
     
     First, we allow to download the deploy plugin.
     Next, we deny access to any other snapshot plugin on people.apache.org.
